# NdinePay 
Digital payments ¬∑ FinTech engineering ¬∑ Open-source enthusiast

Hi ‚Äî I‚Äôm Ndinethemba Futshane. I design and build secure, reliable digital payment systems and prototypes that turn financial complexity into clean developer experiences. I maintain NdinePay (Digital Payment System) and a JSON-driven Mobile Banking Prototype that demonstrates a minimal, testable user flow for deposits, transactions, and profile management.

## üöÄ Projects & Prototypes

### NdinePay ‚Äî Digital Payment System
A production-oriented digital payments platform focused on reliability, reconciliation, and developer experience.
- Repo: https://github.com/Cryptopreneur69/NdinePay
- Highlights: API-first design, secure authentication, transaction auditing, reconciliation tools

### Mobile Banking Prototype (mobile_banking_prototype.json)
A lightweight, JSON-defined prototype outlining a mobile banking UI and navigation flow ‚Äî perfect for rapid UX iterations or as a seed for a frontend implementation.

Key aspects of the prototype:
- App name: Mobile Banking Prototype
- Purpose: Fast, testable prototype to explore deposit flows, transactions list, and profile editing.
- JSON-driven screens and navigation so frontends can be generated or mocked quickly.

Screens included:
- Home Screen
  - Buttons: Deposit, Transactions, Profile
- Deposit Screen
  - Input: Amount
  - Button: Confirm Deposit ‚Üí Confirm Deposit Screen
- Confirm Deposit Screen
  - Text: "Confirm deposit of {Amount}?"
  - Buttons: Yes, Confirm ‚Üí Success; Cancel ‚Üí Deposit
- Success Screen
  - Text: "Deposit Successful ‚úÖ"
  - Button: Back to Home
- Transactions Screen
  - List: Recent Transactions
  - Back ‚Üí Home
- Profile Screen
  - Text: User Info
  - Buttons: Edit Profile ‚Üí Edit Profile Screen; Back ‚Üí Home
- Edit Profile Screen
  - Inputs: Name, Email
  - Save ‚Üí Profile

Navigation / flow (high level)
- Home ‚Üí Deposit ‚Üí Confirm Deposit ‚Üí Success ‚Üí Home
- Home ‚Üí Transactions ‚Üí Home
- Home ‚Üí Profile ‚Üí Edit Profile ‚Üí Profile ‚Üí Home

This prototype is intentionally minimal to keep the UX focused and the implementation portable between frameworks (React Native, Flutter, web mockups, or a static visualizer).

## üõ†Ô∏è How I use prototypes like this
- Rapid UI/UX validation without heavy frontend engineering
- Auto-generate mock screens from JSON for demos and user testing
- Feed the same JSON into a storybook-like visualizer or a simple single-page app that walks through the flows
- Use it as a contract for backend endpoints (e.g., deposit confirmation ‚Üí transaction creation)

Example quick-start ideas:
- Create a small React or Vue app that reads mobile_banking_prototype.json and renders screens for each `id`.
- Build a Cypress / Playwright test that exercises the deposit flow by following `arrows` from the JSON.
- Use the JSON to generate a sequence diagram for stakeholder reviews.

## üß≠ Tech & skills (typical stack for these projects)
- Languages: JavaScript / TypeScript, Python, Go
- Frameworks: React / React Native / Next.js, Node.js, FastAPI
- Databases: PostgreSQL, Redis
- Infrastructure: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS (Lambda, ECS, RDS), Terraform
- Payments & Security: Webhooks, tokenization, PCI-aware design, audit trails
- Testing & CI: Unit / integration tests, end-to-end tests, GitHub Actions
- AI Tools : Adole, Copilot, Github Copilot, OpenAI ChatGPT-5, DeepSeek, N8N & many more.

## ü§ù Contributing / Using the prototype
- Want a runnable demo? I can scaffold a small frontend that consumes the JSON and demonstrates the full flow.
- Want it extended? Tell me which screens, validations, or payment integrations to add (webhook, reconciliation sample data, mock ledger).
- Suggestions: Add sample transaction data to the JSON to demo the Transactions screen; add validation and error states for deposit.

## ‚ö° Quick wins I can do next
- Generate a live demo (React/React Native) from mobile_banking_prototype.json
- Add sample data and UI states (loading, error, empty)
- Add badges (CI, coverage, license) and dynamic GitHub stats to this README
